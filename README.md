# Tanzania Buildcon International Expo 2027 — Website

Production website for **Tanzania Buildcon International Expo 2027**, 25–27 August 2027,
Diamond Jubilee Hall, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Jointly organised by Futurex Trade Fair &
Events Pvt. Ltd. and Exhibitions & Trade Services India Pvt. Ltd. (ETSIPL).

Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, MongoDB, Google Sheets sync,
Nodemailer, GSAP and Auth.js.

## Documentation

- [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) — production deployment steps
- [DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md](./DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md) — required production inputs and
  post-deployment verification checklist
- [ADMIN_GUIDE.md](./ADMIN_GUIDE.md) — how organiser staff use `/admin`
- [CONTENT_GUIDE.md](./CONTENT_GUIDE.md) — where and how to update content
- [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) — every env var explained
- [QA_REPORT.md](./QA_REPORT.md) — what was tested and known limitations

## Production services

- **MongoDB** — primary datastore and source of truth for all 5 lead forms. A form submission
  is only ever considered accepted after a successful MongoDB write; Google Sheets and email
  are secondary and never affect that outcome (see [DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md](./DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md)).
- **Google Sheets** — best-effort operational copy of each lead, synced via a service account.
- **Email (Nodemailer)** — best-effort organiser notification + visitor acknowledgement per
  submission; OAuth2 preferred, Gmail App Password as fallback.
- **Auth.js** — session-based admin authentication, credentials provider.
- **Analytics** (GA4 / Meta Pixel / LinkedIn Insight) — optional, only loaded after cookie
  consent is accepted.

## Production deployment

Primary target: **Vercel**. Full steps, environment variable setup, custom domain/SSL, MongoDB
Atlas network access, and rollback are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md). A Node-hosting
fallback path is documented there too — the app avoids Vercel-only APIs.

After deploying, work through [DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md](./DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md)'s checklist
before considering the site launched.

## Local development

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local` with real values (see [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)).
At minimum, for the site to render, no variables are required — pages relying on the
database (exhibitors, news, gallery, downloads, partners) gracefully render empty states
without `MONGODB_URI` configured.

### 3. Set up MongoDB

Use a local MongoDB instance or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (recommended
for production). Set `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`.

### 4. Seed the initial admin user

```bash
npm run seed:admin
```

Requires `MONGODB_URI`, `ADMIN_INITIAL_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD` to be set in
`.env.local`. Re-running updates the password for an existing admin.

### 5. Configure Google Sheets (optional but recommended)

See the Google Sheets section of [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md), then run:

```bash
npm run setup:sheets
```

This creates the required tabs and header rows in your spreadsheet without touching any
existing data.

### 6. Configure email

See the Email section of [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md), then verify with:

```bash
npm run test:email -- you@example.com
```

### 7. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000. Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin/login.

### 8. Run tests

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:e2e
```

### 9. Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Key architectural notes

- **`src/proxy.ts`** protects `/admin/*` — Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`;
  don't recreate a `middleware.ts` file, it will not run.
- **`src/config/event.ts`** is the single source of truth for the event name, dates, venue
  and contact details. Never hardcode these elsewhere.
- Dynamic sections (exhibitor directory, partners, news, gallery, downloads) query MongoDB
  and render an empty state or hide themselves when there's no data — this is intentional
  per the brief (no placeholder/fake content in production).
- All 5 lead forms (Book a Stand, Register to Visit, Contact, Partnership Enquiry,
  Newsletter) follow the same pattern: Zod validation → MongoDB save (blocking) → Google
  Sheets sync (best-effort) → email notification (best-effort) → success response with a
  reference ID. Sheets/email failures never lose the MongoDB submission.
